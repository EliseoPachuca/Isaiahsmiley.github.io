                    <h2> Background </h2>
                    <p>In the 20th century, pertussis was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood mortality in the United States. Before the availability of
pertussis vaccine in the 1940s, more than 200,000 cases of pertussis were reported annually. Since widespread use of the vaccine began,
incidence has decreased more than 80% compared with the prevaccine era.</p>
