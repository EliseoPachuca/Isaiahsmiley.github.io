 <h1> I Am "Who I AM" </h1>
 <p>I am African American </p>
 <p> Accept it or leave it </p>
 <p>Bring me up donâ€™t bring me down  </p>
 <p>I gotta keep pushing just to achieve it </p>
 <p> It's hard in this hood trust and believe it </p>
 <p> They throwing my sista's and brotha's in the gutta </p>
 <p> This system ain't meant for us to proceed it </p>
 <p> But I broke this system <b>.</b> </p>
 <p> I give then I take  </p>
 <p> I don't just recieve</p>
 <p> They give us these stereotypes<p/>
 <p> And they leave us decieved </p>
 <p> But listen cuz all we gotta do is retrieve </p>
 <p> And that's easy because our street mentality got us perceived</p>
 <p> Just remember y'all, knowledge is the key</p>
 <p> S like I said earlier just trut and believe.</p>
